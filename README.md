# ReplaceExtractScript
A script to extract or replace segments of text using begin-end markers in files. Primarily this was intended to allow me to extract script code segments from various scripts and make them a part of other scripts, but can be used to replace blocks of text in any text file.

The script itself has markers for both the ExtractSegment and ReplaceSegment script functions so that they too, can be pulled out of the script to be included into other scripts.

Markers for functions blocks

code-begin ExtractSegment
